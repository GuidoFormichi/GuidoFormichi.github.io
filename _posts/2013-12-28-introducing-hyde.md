title: About me
---

Hi! I'm a PhD student in Linguistics at [IUSS](https://www.iusspavia.it/it/rubrica/guido-formichi) Pavia, working on the Syntax and the Prosody of a specific kind of sentence structure (known as `Right Dislocation') in which some material appears at the right edge of the clause, under the supervision of Andrea Moro.

### My research interests

My reasearch interests concern:

* Theoretical Syntax issues (in particular dislocations and linearization)
* The Syntax - Prosody interface
* Prososdic analysis (segmentation and intonation)
* Information Structure cooncepts

### My academic bio

I graduated from the Modern Literature Bachelor Course at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice in 2020 with a thesis in narratology entitled *"Il ruolo del lettore nelle teorie letterarie e nella letteratura contemporanea: Iser, Eco e Calvino"*. I then attended the Master's Degree in Linguistics at the University of Padua, specializing in theoretical linguistics and syntax. I graduated in 2023 with a thesis entitled *"Clitic Right Dislocation in Italian: A syntactic and prosodic study"*, under the supervision of Emanuela Sanfelici and Giuliano Bocci.
