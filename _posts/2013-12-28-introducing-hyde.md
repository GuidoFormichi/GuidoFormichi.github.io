title: About me
---

Hi! I'm a PhD student in Linguistics at [IUSS](https://www.iusspavia.it/it/rubrica/guido-formichi) Pavia, working on the Syntax and the Prosody of a specific kind of sentence structure (known as `Right Dislocation') in which some material appears at the right edge of the clause, under the supervision of Andrea Moro.

### My research interests

My reasearch interests concern:

* Theoretical Syntax issues
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### My bio

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes
